        By integrating remoteStorage into your app, you give your users the choice of where to store their personal data. Additionally you don't have to worry about implementing your own backend solution. remoteStorage.js is a JavaScript library that does the heavy-lifting of connecting to any remoteStorage backend, caching, synchronizing and storing user data.

        Before diving into the code, here is a general overview of the key aspects:

        #### Let your users connect

        <img class="widget" src="/img/widget.png" alt="widget">

        The remoteStorage widget allows your users to connect to their personal storage server. By default it is part of every app that uses remoteStorage.js. It thus serves as an indicator for users to immediately recognize that they can use their own storage with an app.

        Find out more about integrating the widget in the API docs:
        [displayWidget](http://remotestoragejs.com/doc/code/files/remoteStorage-js.html#remoteStorage.displayWidget)

        #### Define your data
        The next step is to decide what data you want to store from your app. This is done by using a module. A module provides a method of reading and writing a certain defined type of data (ie. documents, contacts, images). You can choose from a variety of common and custom modules that already exist, or build your own.
        For each module that your app uses, you need to claim access. When the user logs into their remoteStorage provder, they will see which modules your app requests access to, and grant permission.
