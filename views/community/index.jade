            ### [GitHub](https://github.com/remotestorage)

            All source code is hosted on GitHub, and we use GitHub's issues, pull

            ### [Mailing list](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.io/issues)

            We retired all existing mailing lists in favor of dicussing things
            via GitHub Issues in the remotestorage.io repository. If you're
            still using an old mailing list, you probably won't get a response.

            #### What to use it for:

            * Discussing the remoteStorage project
            * Announcing your remoteStorage-enabled app for test and feedback

        ### Meet people in person

        remoteStorage folks are travelling a lot, and it's rumored some of them
        don't even have a home address. So chances are good you can meet people
        in person, learn about remoteStorage at a conference, or even be part
        of a remoteStorage hackathon. Be sure to [follow us on
        Twitter](https://twitter.com/remotestorage_) to receive event
        announcements!

        #### The Unhosted Unconference

        Every year in September, we throw an uncoference-style event in a small
        town called Unhost, right next to Prague. During these days we discuss
        the whole project, learn about new developments, work on issues, make
        larger decisions, and most importantly: have a lot of fun and learn to
        know each other. Check out and [track the next one on
        Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2013/unhosted/)!
