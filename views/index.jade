        h3 Own your data
        :markdown
          Everything in one place â€“ your place. Use a storage account with a
          provider you trust, or set up your own storage server. Move house
          whenever you want. It's your data.
      section.sync
        h3 Stay in sync
        :markdown
          remoteStorage-enabled apps automatically sync your data across all
          of your devices, from desktop to tablet to smartphone, and even your TV.

        h3 Compatibility is king
        :markdown
          Use the same data across different apps. Create a to-do list in one
          app, and track the time on your tasks in another one. Say goodbye to data
          silos.

        h3 Go offline
        :markdown
          Offline support is built into remoteStorage.js by default. Use your
          apps offline on the go, and automatically sync when you're back online.

        h3 Backend as a Service
        :markdown
          Develop your web app without worrying about hosting or even developing
          the backend for it: your users will connect their own backend at runtime.

        h3 New apps come prefilled
        :markdown
          When using an app for the first time, you don't have to go through profile
          setup; start using the app straight away, with all your existing user data.
